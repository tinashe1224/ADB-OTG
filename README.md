Android SDK Platform-Tools is a component for the Android SDK.
It includes tools that interface with the Android platform, primarily
[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and
[`fastboot`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/#fastboot).
Although `adb` is required for Android app development, app developers will
normally just use the copy Studio installs. This download is useful if you want
to use `adb` directly from the command-line and don't have Studio installed.
(If you do have Studio installed, you might want to just use the copy it
installed because Studio will automatically update it.) `fastboot` is needed
if you want to unlock your device bootloader and flash it with a new system
image. This package used to contain `systrace`, but that has been obsoleted in
favor of Studio Profiler, gpuinspector.dev, or Perfetto.

Although some new features in `adb` and `fastboot` are available only for recent
versions of Android, they're backward compatible, so you should only need the
latest version of the SDK Platform-Tools and should file bugs if you find
exceptions.

## Downloads

If you're an Android developer, you should get the latest
SDK Platform-Tools from Android Studio's [SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager) or from the
[`sdkmanager`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager)
command-line tool. This ensures the tools are saved to the right place with
the rest of your Android SDK tools and easily updated.

But if you want just these command-line tools, use the following links:

- <button class="devsite-dialog-button button-white button-regular" data-modal-dialog-id="dac-download-windows-dialog-id"> Download SDK Platform-Tools for Windows</button>
- <button class="devsite-dialog-button button-white button-regular" data-modal-dialog-id="dac-download-mac-dialog-id"> Download SDK Platform-Tools for Mac</button>
- <button class="devsite-dialog-button button-white button-regular" data-modal-dialog-id="dac-download-linux-dialog-id"> Download SDK Platform-Tools for Linux</button>

Although these links do not change, they always point to the most recent version
of the tools.

  other attached USB devices.

#### 25.0.4 (March 16, 2017)

- Added experimental libusb support to Linux and Mac adb

To use the libusb backend, set the environment variable ADB_LIBUSB=true before
launching a new adb server. The new `adb host-features` command will tell you
whether or not you're using libusb.

To restart adb with libusb and check that it worked, use `adb kill-server;
ADB_LIBUSB=1 adb start-server; adb host-features`. The output should include
"libusb".

In this release, the old non-libusb implementation remains the default.

If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

### 14. General Legal Terms

14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. *July 27, 2021* I have read and agree with the above terms and conditions <button class="button button-disabled"> Download Android SDK Platform-Tools for Linux </button> [Download Android SDK Platform-Tools
